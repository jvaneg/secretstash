secretstash is a program that stashes secrets for you in my directory where no one (except me!) can see them.
Just in case someone does manage to get into my account though,
the secrets are also encrypted with a xor stream cipher (variant of the vigenere cipher),
using a personalized key for every user.

secretstash has two modes, stash and pop:

Stash reads a secret from stdin, encrypts it, and stashes it in a folder given by the user's uid, as a file named after the passed in secret name.
Ex: echo -n "joel is cool" | ./secretstash "coolsecret"

Pop retrieves a secret from your uid folder, decrypts it, and prints it to stdout.
Ex: ./secretstash -p "coolsecret"

Your goal is to retrieve, decrypt, and read someone else's secret.
